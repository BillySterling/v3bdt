                        <p> The Behavioral Data Tracker v.3 (React Phase) is a behavioral tracking application for whole-interval recording developed by Sarah Kinneer, Billy Sterling, Lisa Stasio, and Jodi Woodard. This app was designed for ease of use and to reduce redundant data entry in many classroom behavioral tracking systems. The app collects data and updates charts in real time to display behavioral trends in order to help professionals evaluate the effectiveness of behavioral interventions.
                        </p>
                        <p>Although the app was specifically designed for use with students with severe emotional/behavioral disabilities requiring frequent behavioral monitoring, it can be used by teachers serving any population of students.  Please note that this is a prototype for further development incorporating fictitious data and utilizes moderate security measures to protect student data.  As strict security analysis has yet to be completed, please do NOT use this version to store any real student data.  The developers are not responsible for the misuse of this application. 
                        </p>
                        <p>To access the demo teacher page, enter the username 'misstanner@fenceworkshop.com' and password 'Password1!' on the login page. Since 'Becky Tanner' is a fictitious staff member, you will see her dashboard page with fictitious students and their goals ready for rating. Feel free to enter data by selecting radio buttons corresponding with whether or not each student met his/her behavior goal(s) during a rating interval and clicking the 'SAVE DATA' button. This button saves a rating instance to the database. It is up to the team working with each student to determine rating intervals.  Not all students necessarily need to be rated at each interval (the app is designed to handle null/undefined inputs). Click on a student name and behavior in the left navigation pane to view that student's behavioral progress over time. These charts show the average percentage of intervals the identified goal was met each day.
                        </p>
                        <p>There are plans to develop this application further, including adding student/parent and admin interfaces as well as additional behavioral monitoring features (such as student self-monitoring, frequency counts, duration recording, random instance recording, etc.).  We also plan to add additional security measures to ensure that student data is protected per FERPA and COPPA regulations.
                        </p>
                        <p>The user interface for this site was adapted from the admin Materialize template, which was heavily modified in version 3.
